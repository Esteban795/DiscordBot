# DiscordBot

Welcome to my first Discord Bot ! Here you can find the source code I've written. This is still a beta version of this bot, so make sure to report any bug that you encounter !


### Requirements

- This bot needs you to first install discord.py :

For a basic installation :

```ps
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
If you also want voice support : 

```ps
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

- This bot requires you to have a bot token stored in a .env file. It should look like :

```txt
BOT_TOKEN = [your bot token]
```

- You also may need to install the "requests" library if you didn't use it before !

```ps
python3 -m pip install -U request.py
```

### **The bot prefix is : $. I don't plan on changing it, but I will edit this line if it ever happens !**




Not up to date. I will work on readme soon enough.
